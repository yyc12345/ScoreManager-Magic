# ScoreManager-Magic

A [*Ballance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballance) game plugin provides speedrun and statistics data exporting.

This repository contains the core functions of *ScoreManager*, including `menulevel.nmo` injection, data capture, verify and analyze.

Fork from [ScoreManager-Core](https://github.com/BearKidsTeam/ScoreManager-Core). This app's function is similar to ScoreManager-Core but it provides a friendly user interface and account system \(this function is existing in ScoreManager but not included in ScoreManager-Core and I don't use ScoreManager's backend code due to denied permission\)

## Tutorial

Clone, Compile and Run.

Requires .NET Framework 4.5 or later, but 4.0 should work.

See [Releases](https://github.com/BearKidsTeam/ScoreManager-Core/releases) for pre-compiled binary files.

## Hints

Put all files(including `.exe` and `.nmo`) in any folder and execute, it will automatically search Ballance location in registry and do game file injection. If it reports a failure, you need to manually input the game folder.

The program needs reading and writing permission, so if you are running it or *Ballance* in your **system partition**, please use `Run as Administrator` (The program itself was configured by `app.manifest` in compilation, but you need to configure *Ballance* `Player.exe` by yourself).

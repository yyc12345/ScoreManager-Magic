# ScoreManager-Magic Website

The website front-end for ScoreManager-Magic.

This project inherits almost features and styles of BallanceScore\(ScoreManager's website\). And ambition is simulating osu! website design.

## Used lib

Due to my personal perferences. I use as pure as possible JavaScript.

* JQuery: For convenient code operation.
* Bulma: Main CSS provider.

## Installation

Deploy it freely, but you should mind this should be work with SMMBackend. Website will use JSONP to communicate with backend.
